<p>From Leanne's website: Hi!  I'm Leanne Guenther, creator of DLTK's Educational Activities for Kids.  My main passion is crafts for kids, but every so often I get inspired to write a poem, story or play.

My daughters have been inspiring this website for nearly two decades now -- it's a cliche but time really does fly by!

I was born and raised in Saskatchewan, Canada.  I attended the University of Saskatchewan (sometime in the past millenium *wink*) and then moved, with my husband, to Calgary, Alberta, Canada -- a beautiful city full of friendly people (and jobs!)

My hobbies include the websites, gardening, travel and reading historical novels (Phillipa Gregory is my current favorite author).</p>
