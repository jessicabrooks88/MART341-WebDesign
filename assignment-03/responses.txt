1. Provide three websites that you enjoy visiting?
	www.pinterest.com
	www.shein.com
	www.amazon.com

2. What is the relationship between an IP address and the DNS?
	DNS is the Domain Name System. It is an internet service that translates domain names/host names to IP addresses
and IP addresses to their associated domain names/host names with the help of a DNS server. An IP address is used to identify
the computer that is connected to the internet and is a displayed as a group of numbers seperated by dots.

3. What is a cookie?
	A cookie is a small text file that has been given an ID tag. It is stored in your computer's browser directory or
program data subfolders.

4. List the three essential parts of a URL.
	Three essential parts are: scheme, host, and a path. The scheme is the HTTP part. A host is the name that identifies
the resource. For example, in Amazon.com, the host would be the .com part. The path identifies the specific resource in the host
that the web client wants to access. If you are looking through blog posts, for example, your URL might 
read: www.wordpress.com/blog/archives. The path is "/blog/archives."

5. In your README.md, use Markdown and add the title
"Assignment 3" with a heading 1. Underneath, add your name as
a heading 2.

6. Add a list of 3 things you've learned so far.
	So far I have learned what a cookie is, which I never knew and simply hit "accept" when a website would mention
the storing of them. I learned that the DNS system works in tandem with the IP address to identify my computer. I am also
starting to understand the usefulness and context of README files and why they are important--again something I previously
dismissed because I wasn't sure what its use was. Learning a lot so far!
