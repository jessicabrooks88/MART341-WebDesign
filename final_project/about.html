    <i>Night of Girl</i> is an immersive gaming experience designed by Jessica Brooks.
It is a third-person PC game that follows the protagonist Andie through point-
and-click puzzles that will guarantee her escape if she succeeds and defeats her
captors' cronies. She starts the game trapped in a billionaire's basement and
spends the duration going through each level, equipping unlikely objects as weapons,
trying to get outside to the woods. Here, she must ultimately kill her kidnapper, the
elusive Mr. Hands. The game has a sense of humor with a pop culture flair that sets
it apart from other horror games and grabs influence from past point-and-click games
like Myst and Harvester with a cute aesthetic from RPG's like Story of Seasons to
create a creepy contrast. It is rated M for Violence and Strong Language.
