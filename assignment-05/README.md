I went to MySpace using the Wayback Machine. I chose to go to October 2007 because that's when I remember using it. It looked so plain and it had all the nostalgia I could have hoped for. It had a featured band on the homepage, which was Emery, and of course selfies of different people you can send a friend request to under the login area. MySpace now looks a lot like the Yahoo News homepage.
My experience with these last few topics have been good. I love the sleek formatting of Atom. It's easy to figure out what goes where and I am learning how to do it right, although slowly. The only thing I really have trouble with right now are links, but I plan on working to grasp a more natural understanding of how to use them in Atom. Relative URLs in particular confuse me a bit.
