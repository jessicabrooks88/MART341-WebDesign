The Early 2000's were an interesting time for fashion.
Bright colors and shiny tones from the '60s and '70s were back, and the animal print and thin eyebrows
were still trending. Girl Power was going strong, so feminine colors like baby blue, pink, and purple were
here to stay. But with the mid-2000s approaching, we saw a few things changing. For one, newer
brands were emerging, like Ed Hardy, Juicy Couture, Delia's, and UGG boots were becoming popular, too. Preppy looks
were back as well, but got a more toned-down image, with teenager girls favoring skinny jeans and nude colors, basically
trying their best to look like Lauren Conrad. Abercrombie & Fitch was a closet staple, as well as Hollister and American Eagle.
It was a time that seemed to celebrate excess in a more attainable, fun way. A time where you could wear fluffy boots, velour
pajamas, and light blue sunglasses with a trucker hat out in public. And the next day you could be wearing a polo and khaki shorts
with Converse shoes. It was a style that captured many different eras
and churned them out into one beautiful mess.
