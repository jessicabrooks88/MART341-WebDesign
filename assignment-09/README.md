1. Briefly recap your experience learning HTML. What was old, new, interesting, or
difficult to learn?
It has been difficult trying to piece all of the things we have learned together into one project. It took a longer time to do that than the individual assignments have in the past. But I am also see how they all work together to make a more cohesive product.
2. Next module we continue with CSS and expand on styling, which helps us
"decorate" HTML. Is there anything you're anxious or excited to learn about in
this new section?
I am really looking forward to learning more about styling. The only thing I am worried about is being able to apply what I have already learned without hitting as many snags, so I can focus on absorbing the new information.
3. Free Response: Summarize your challenges and successes. What did you do to
overcome your challenges?
I relied on the course material to help me overcome any issues I had, and when that didn't work, I took to the HTML shortcuts website. I struggled with where to place things throughout the assignment but even though it is a little disorganized I think I got the basic idea down. The only thing I was confused about was how to do the image part, specifically image optimization for web. It was hard to find information on it and I didn't find it as easily in google as I thought I would. I plan on doing more research on it and trying again when it comes up in another assignment.
