1. A system font are those that are already installed on your local device and system. Web fonts are custom fonts hosted on a server. They do not have to be available on the user's device to appear, but require certain elements to get called up correctly. Fonts that developers can count on being available by the system are known as "Web-safe" fonts.
2. It is important to have fallback fonts in the event that the user is trying to view your page but the device does not have the capability of viewing it in that font because it doesn't have access to it. It basically will choose the next best thing.
3. I found this to be a little less challenging than Homework 10's assignment. I think because I was able to focus just on fonts this week, it helped me figure out what I was doing a little easier. I liked the way the lesson plan was set up a lot this week and found it helpful.
