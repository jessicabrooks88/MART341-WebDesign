1. I learned a lot about web development this semester in general. It's hard to pin down just one thing. I went into this class not knowing anything about web design except for basic HTML code I used back during the Myspace/Xanga era, which I barely remembered anyway.
2. HTML was easier for me to grasp this semester than the CSS design coding, so I learned that a lot more work goes into creating the look of a website than I thought. Again, everything I learned this semester was new to me.
3. The biggest challenge I had with this project was making sure everything connected properly, as I was having trouble with navigation bars up until this point. I think I finally got it. I watched some tutorials and went over the lesson plans again and when I got stuck I googled how to do what was necessary. This is a really simple design but I think I was able to convey what I learned throughout the semester and meet the requirements.
