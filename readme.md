1. A universal selector type is used to style every element on the page. An element selector is used to select all elements of a certain type. Class selectors select elements that serve the same function. ID selector allows developers to define style rules for a specific element by calling its unique ID. You might choose one or the other depending on the context of your code, but you would probably most often be using the universal selector type because it is the most efficient and relevant for basic coding.
2. I am still struggling with CSS so I chose a couple of different colors and wrote them in in different ways, but what I was trying to go for was text colors blue and pink on each of the pages. I think I changed it to black later on on the CSS to show that I knew how to make a CSS comment.
3. While I am understanding what is being asked and how to write it out, I'm still having a lot of trouble with placement. I think I figured out how to link the style sheet finally but I don't know if they're working. I tried to run the code on my own to check my work but I can't figure it out. I think the major issue I'm having is "what code goes where?" I know which code I'm supposed to enter in but I don't know how they all connect, if that makes sense. And if they aren't connecting and running properly, how do I organize them in a way that will make them work?
