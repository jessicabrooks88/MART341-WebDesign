What is the difference between padding, margin, and borders?
Padding changes the size of individual boxes and controls the relationships of elements to each other. It is the amount of space between the inner content of the element and the element itself. Margin is the space between the box/element and other elements, or the edge of the parent element. Borders are defined by three values: width, style, and color. They can be created in one lump property or each side and property individually.

I relied heavily on the course material to complete the assignment, as I always do. I was having trouble running the code to check what it looked like, so I couldn't preview it. I understand how all of the elements function, I was again just unsure of where to put them on the style sheet. So I mostly placed them all in order according to the assignment, except for when I felt it didn't make sense to put it there. This is something I plan on improving on and trying to figure out better.
