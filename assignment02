Week 2 Homework 

 

How is the world wide web different than the internet?  

The internet is a networking infrastructure. This means that it is a network that connects computers together globally so that any computer can communicate with another. The world wide web is the tool we use to access the internet. 

2. Briefly describe how the internet works. 

The internet is a network that communicates between computers. It sends a signal to communicate with other computers all over the world when they are connected to it over the web. 

 3. What is a directory, and what is its relationship to files?  

A directory is an operating system. According to the lesson, directory structural organization resembles a tree, with a single root that branches off into related groups of content. Root directory is the top-most directory and the current folder you are in is the active directory. Any directories inside the current directory are called subdirectories. 

4. How will VCS benefit you?  

It allows you to compare files, identify changes, and merge the changes if needed prior to committing the code. It helps identify which version is currently being developed. It is an easier way to change your code and fix problems without causing issues. 

5. Take a screenshot anytime while working on your homework.  

 

6. What is your favorite kind of art? 

My favorite kind of art is sketch comedy. I like it because it’s usually to the point and there are several sensory aspects necessary to enjoy it, like you’re hearing it and seeing it so it’s got more opportunity to interact with it. 

7. Rename this screenshot using proper naming conventions, and upload it to your assignment02 directory. README Every assignment will need a README file, each containing a description of this week's tasks
