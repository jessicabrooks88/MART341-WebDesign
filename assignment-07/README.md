The only forums I really hang out on are WebMD because I like learning about medical stuff and I'm also a hypochondriac. I also love to cook so I frequent pinterest forums quite a bit! The purpose of these forums is to share personal experience and helpful information.
Text is when you want to create plain text. Selection is used for drop-down menus, etc. Button input could be used for a submit button, like when asking for an email or a signature on a digital document.
My work cycle for the assignment was to use the homework walkthrough to better understand what we're trying to do. I like them because they're little tutorials and easy to follow for the most part. I only have to consult Google for a few things here and there. I try my best to not only do the assignment but actually understand what it is that I'm doing. It takes a little longer because I'm reading through everything, but I find that I learn better this way.
